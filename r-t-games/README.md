## **_Description_**

#### We wanted to create an app that helps avid gamers find possible games that they might be interested in buying in the future. Gamers can leave reviews on certain games or even add games that might not be already listed. They will also be able to edit or delete their listing if they wanted to aswell. We're doing this project together to brush up or group coding skills and to further enhance our coding knowledge/efficiency.
